## Compliance with Unsplash API Guidelines

The application adheres to the [Unsplash API guidelines](https://help.unsplash.com/en/articles/2511245-unsplash-api-guidelines) to ensure responsible and respectful usage of their resources. These guidelines cover both technical requirements and usage policies, in particular:

- The application uses the hotlinked image URLs provided by the Unsplash API for displaying images.
- All images displayed are properly attributed to Unsplash and the respective photographers, including links back to their Unsplash profiles with utm parameters for tracking.
- Users are not required to register for a developer account with the Unsplash API to access the application. A proxy solution manages API requests on their behalf.
- Caching is in place on the proxy server to prevent the abuse of Unsplash APIs, ensuring that the application's usage remains within acceptable limits and does not disrupt Unsplash services.
